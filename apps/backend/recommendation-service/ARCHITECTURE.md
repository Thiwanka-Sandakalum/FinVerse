# Recommendation Service Architecture

## Overview

The recommendation service is responsible for generating personalized product recommendations for users of the FinVerse banking application. It leverages user interaction data collected by the interaction service to build a hybrid recommendation model.

## System Components

### 1. API Layer

The API layer exposes RESTful endpoints for consuming recommendations:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/products/{user_id}` - Get personalized product recommendations for a user
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/session/{session_id}` - Get recommendations based on the current session
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/similar-products/{product_id}` - Find similar products
- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/refresh-model` - Manually trigger a model refresh

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer contains the business logic for recommendation generation:

- **RecommendationService**: Core service that orchestrates the recommendation process
- **BankingServiceClient**: Client for fetching product details from the banking service
- **ModelRefreshScheduler**: Service for periodically refreshing the recommendation model

### 3. Model Layer

The model layer handles the implementation of the recommendation algorithm:

- **HybridRecommendationModel**: Implementation of the hybrid recommendation model using LightFM
- **DataPipeline**: Processes and transforms interaction data for model training

### 4. Data Layer

The data layer manages database interactions:

- **DBService**: Service for retrieving interaction data from MongoDB

## Data Flow

1. User interactions with the FinVerse application are tracked by the interaction service
2. The recommendation service periodically retrieves interaction data from MongoDB
3. The data pipeline processes and transforms the data for model training
4. The hybrid recommendation model is trained using the processed data
5. When a recommendation request is received, the model generates personalized recommendations
6. Product details are enriched using the banking service API
7. The recommendations are returned to the client

## Recommendation Algorithm

### Hybrid Approach

The service uses a hybrid recommendation system that combines:

1. **Collaborative filtering**: Learns from user-product interactions to identify patterns and similarities between users and products.
2. **Content-based filtering**: Uses features of products and user preferences to recommend similar items.

This hybrid approach helps address common challenges in recommendation systems:

- **Cold start problem**: For new users or products with limited interaction data
- **Data sparsity**: When the interaction data is sparse (many users, many products, few interactions)
- **Relevance**: Ensuring recommendations are relevant to user interests

### LightFM Implementation

The service uses the LightFM library, which implements a hybrid recommendation algorithm:

- **Matrix factorization**: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional user and item representations
- **Feature incorporation**: Integrates user and item features into the factorization process
- **WARP loss function**: Optimizes for ranking performance, ensuring top recommendations are relevant

## Integration Points

### Interaction Service

- **Data source**: Provides user interaction data for model training
- **Interface**: MongoDB database shared between services

### Banking Service

- **Product details**: Provides detailed information about financial products
- **Interface**: RESTful API

## Scalability Considerations

- **Model refresh**: Model training is performed asynchronously at configurable intervals
- **Caching**: Recommendation results can be cached to improve performance
- **Horizontal scaling**: The service can be horizontally scaled for handling increased request load

## Future Enhancements

- **A/B testing framework**: For evaluating different recommendation strategies
- **Real-time recommendations**: Incorporate real-time user behavior for immediate recommendation updates
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Optimize for multiple objectives (e.g., relevance, diversity, business goals)
- **Contextual recommendations**: Incorporate context (time, location, device) into the recommendation process
- **Explainable recommendations**: Provide explanations for why certain items are recommended
